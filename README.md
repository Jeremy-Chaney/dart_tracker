# DART Tracker

Scripting to track the [DART](https://dart.org) (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) trains using [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) (General Transit Feed Specification) data.

## About

This script is intended to be used as an example for fetching transit data using Python. While this repo focuses mainly on the Dallas-based DART system, applying this to other cities' transit systems should only require minor modifications to where the data is being fetched from.
